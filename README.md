## Description

We built this site for users to be able to find a book recommendation by searching for an author's name or by genre.

Our site is the ultimate all-in-one site for book and movie lovers and will save the user time from having to search multiple sites for this information. We learned how to use third party API's in order for this site to function as needed.
