## Description

We built this site for users to be able to find a book recommendation by searching for an author's name or by selecting a genre. The thing that sets our site apart from other book recommendation sites is that our site will also show if there is a corresponding movie or show, if one is available, and will tell the user where it can be streamed. Our site is the ultimate all-in-one site for book and movie lovers and will save the user time from having to search multiple sites for this information. We learned how to use third party API's in order for this site to function as needed.

## Installation

There is no installation needed for this site and it can be accessed at ________________________________.

## Usage

To use our site, simply enter in an author's name or select a genre that you would like to receive recommendations for. Once the user hits the submit button, a list will appear which will have the search results with a list of the title of the book, author, genre, and a brief description of the book. On the right hand side of the page, a list of movies or shows will be listed that correspond with your book search results and it will let the user know what streaming company has the show or movie available to watch.
